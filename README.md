# SinaMicroBlog-iWatch

This is a [Sina Microblog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo) App for Apple Watch and is motivated by [CoderMJLee](https://github.com/CoderMJLee)'s IOS course project.

## Motivation
Sina Microblog is one of the most popular social network in China. However, there is still no good app available for App Watch. Thus, I design and implement the first App for Apple Watch which has the following outstanding features:
1. It's an app for Apple Watch that allows users to access Sina microblog via     Apple Watch;
2. It's the **first** Apple Watch app that can refresh and load more status;         
3. It's the **first** Apple Watch app that can display shared status;
4. It allows users to read more detailed information about a status;
5. It allows users to 'like' or 'share' status.
